# Project Description

This project is a code representation of the design provided in the following Figma file: [Figma Design]([link-to-figma-file](https://www.figma.com/file/lLiQIC8pJOOICR5RWDktOz/ITFOLKS-Devlopment?type=design&node-id=0-1)).

## Code Details

- The codebase is written in TypeScript and utilizes both ReactJS and React Native frameworks.

- The project follows the principles of Atomic Design, a methodology for designing and structuring components in a scalable and reusable manner. More information about Atomic Design can be found in the [official documentation](link-to-atomic-design-docs).

- For the desktop version, Sass was used as the styling preprocessor, providing enhanced capabilities and modularity in styling.

- Material UI, a popular React component library, was employed for the desktop version. Material UI offers a wide range of pre-designed components and styling options, enabling rapid development. For more information, refer to the [Material UI documentation](link-to-material-ui-docs).

# Responsive Design in the Desktop Application

The desktop application has been designed with a responsive approach to ensure optimal viewing and usability across different screen sizes. The following features contribute to its responsiveness:

## Relative Units in CSS

The desktop application utilizes relative units in CSS, such as percentages (`%`) and `em` units, for specifying dimensions and sizes. By using relative units, elements within the application can adapt to different screen sizes and maintain their proportions.

## Flexible Containers

Flexible containers, such as flexbox and grid, have been implemented in the desktop application's layout. These flexible containers automatically adjust their content's positioning and sizing based on available space, ensuring a responsive layout that accommodates varying screen sizes.

## Media Queries and Breakpoints

To cater to different screen sizes and provide an optimal user experience, the desktop application incorporates media queries with multiple breakpoints. These breakpoints define specific screen widths at which different CSS rules are applied, enabling the layout to adapt accordingly. By using media queries, the application can offer a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

The desktop application applies three different breakpoints within the media queries, allowing for adaptable designs across a range of screen sizes. The specific breakpoints and corresponding CSS rules ensure that the application's layout adjusts and reflows appropriately based on the available screen space.

By combining relative units, flexible containers, and media queries with breakpoints, the desktop application achieves a responsive design that caters to a wide range of screen sizes and provides an optimal user experience.


## React Native Libraries

Several smaller libraries were utilized in the React Native version of the project. These include:

- `react-native-elements`: A library providing a set of customizable UI components for React Native. Documentation: [React Native Elements](link-to-react-native-elements-docs)

- `react-native-paper`: A highly customizable UI library for React Native, offering a variety of pre-designed components. Documentation: [React Native Paper](link-to-react-native-paper-docs)

- `react-native-safe-area-context`: A library that helps with managing safe area insets in React Native applications. It ensures that content is properly displayed on devices with notches or rounded corners. Documentation: [React Native Safe Area Context](link-to-react-native-safe-area-context-docs)

# React Native Application Details

## Expo for Development

For the development of the React Native application, Expo was used as a development tool. Expo is a set of tools and services built around React Native that simplifies the development process by providing various features and benefits.

Expo offers a range of advantages, including:

- **Ease of Setup**: Expo allows for a quick and straightforward setup, enabling developers to start building React Native applications without the need for complex configurations.

- **Development Workflow**: Expo provides a seamless development workflow with features like live reloading, which allows for real-time updates to the application as code changes are made.

- **Cross-Platform Development**: With Expo, it is possible to develop and deploy applications for both iOS and Android platforms using a single codebase.

- **Built-in Features**: Expo includes a set of built-in libraries and components that simplify common tasks, such as handling camera access, geolocation, push notifications, and more.

To learn more about Expo and its capabilities, refer to the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/).

## Android Studio for Emulation

Android Studio, a powerful integrated development environment (IDE), was used for emulating the React Native project during development. Android Studio provides a robust set of tools and features specifically tailored for Android application development.

Android Studio offers the following benefits:

- **Emulation and Testing**: Android Studio provides an Android Emulator that allows developers to simulate various Android devices and test their applications in different environments.

- **Debugging and Profiling**: Android Studio offers advanced debugging and profiling tools, making it easier to identify and resolve issues within the application.

- **Project Management**: Android Studio provides a comprehensive project management system, allowing developers to easily navigate and organize their codebase.

For more information about Android Studio and its capabilities, please refer to the [Android Studio documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio).

## ESLint Configuration

An ESLint configuration file was created to enforce coding standards based on the ReactJS and React Native communities. This configuration helps maintain consistency and improve code quality throughout the project.

## Prettier Configuration

Similarly, a Prettier configuration file was created based on the ReactJS and React Native communities' standards. Prettier is a code formatter that ensures consistent code styling across the project.
