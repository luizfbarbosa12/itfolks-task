# Project Description

This project is a code representation of the design provided in the following Figma file: [Figma Design](link-to-figma-file).

## Code Details

- The codebase is written in TypeScript and utilizes both ReactJS and React Native frameworks.

- The project follows the principles of Atomic Design, a methodology for designing and structuring components in a scalable and reusable manner. More information about Atomic Design can be found in the [official documentation](link-to-atomic-design-docs).

- For the desktop version, Sass was used as the styling preprocessor, providing enhanced capabilities and modularity in styling.

- Material UI, a popular React component library, was employed for the desktop version. Material UI offers a wide range of pre-designed components and styling options, enabling rapid development. For more information, refer to the [Material UI documentation](link-to-material-ui-docs).

## React Native Libraries

Several smaller libraries were utilized in the React Native version of the project. These include:

- `react-native-elements`: A library providing a set of customizable UI components for React Native. Documentation: [React Native Elements](link-to-react-native-elements-docs)

- `react-native-paper`: A highly customizable UI library for React Native, offering a variety of pre-designed components. Documentation: [React Native Paper](link-to-react-native-paper-docs)

- `react-native-safe-area-context`: A library that helps with managing safe area insets in React Native applications. It ensures that content is properly displayed on devices with notches or rounded corners. Documentation: [React Native Safe Area Context](link-to-react-native-safe-area-context-docs)

## ESLint Configuration

An ESLint configuration file was created to enforce coding standards based on the ReactJS and React Native communities. This configuration helps maintain consistency and improve code quality throughout the project.

## Prettier Configuration

Similarly, a Prettier configuration file was created based on the ReactJS and React Native communities' standards. Prettier is a code formatter that ensures consistent code styling across the project.
